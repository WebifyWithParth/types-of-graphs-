## 🔍 Visualizations Included

### 1. 📈 Line Plot
A **line plot** displays information as a series of data points connected by straight line segments. Ideal for showing trends over time or continuous variables.

- Single & multiple line plots
- Customizations: colors, markers, grids
- Built using: `matplotlib.pyplot.plot()`

### 2. 📊 Bar Plot
A **bar plot** represents categorical data with rectangular bars. Useful for comparing quantities across categories.

- Vertical & horizontal bars
- Grouped and stacked bars
- Created using: `matplotlib.pyplot.bar()` and `seaborn.barplot()`

### 3. 🥧 Pie Chart
A **pie chart** shows proportions of a whole. It is circular and divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion.

- Labeled slices with percentage values
- Exploded views for emphasis
- Created using: `matplotlib.pyplot.pie()`
